Android project: socket programming and client/server communication

Objective:
When a button on the Android client’s screen is pressed, the client pokes the server (a PC)
by sending a message. The server maintains a local counter. Upon receiving the client’s message, the
server increases its counter and returns the counter value to the Android phone. The value is subsequently 
displayed on the client’s screen.
